# MyReads Project

it is a library project where you can search for a specific book and add it to a shelf of three shelves:
1.CurrentlyReading
2.WantToRead
3.Read

this blog helped me to understand the javascript required to finish that project

## TL;DR

To get started developing right away:

* install all project dependencies with `npm install`
* start the development server with `npm start`


```



## Important
The backend API uses a fixed set of cached search results and is limited to a particular set of search terms, which can be found in [SEARCH_TERMS.md](SEARCH_TERMS.md). That list of terms are the _only_ terms that will work with the backend, so don't be surprised if your searches for Basket Weaving or Bubble Wrap don't come back with any results.
